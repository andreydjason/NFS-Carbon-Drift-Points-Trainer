Need for Speed Carbon Redux Drift Points Trainer

1 - Click to open NFSC Drift Points Trainer.EXE

2 - When in-game, press CTRL+F1 to activate, do that at the end of the Drift Track (you should see your drift points as 999,999)

Know issues:
- If you are on a Drift Track and disable Drift Physics (with K - using ExtraOptions) and the Trainer is active, the game will crash.
